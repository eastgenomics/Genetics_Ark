### Goal: Finish primer database bc Jethro has loads of stuffs

Agreed upon modifications:
- Add "blue" button (SNP check)
- Add button for last date used (editing mode)
- Editing primers make the SNP status value to go null --> modify behaviour
- Popup message for recalculating coverage
- Fix refreshing page after filtering (it keep the previous filtering constraints)
- Ordering of main table
- Fluff stuff (padding, make it pretty)
- Excel importing mess
- Filter using position: handle single primers (it uses coverage for now)
